## Background
This project was originally created to fulfill credit for an assignment in a class at Boston University. For this assignment, I created a website designed for journalists using Flask-RESTful. The website was designed to handle multiple users uploading multiple files at once.

## Documentation
Please see the "docs" folder

## Features
- Logging in, signing up, ability for a user to change their password
- Uploading multiple files at once
- Viewing a user's list of files
- Sentiment analysis
- Newsfeed ingester (the ability to search up topics and find relevant news articles)
- Saving articles to a "Read Later" page

## Demonstration
- Website hosted at http://3.91.102.109:80 (currently offline)
- Please see a demonstration of how the website is used in "FinalDemo.mp4" in the folder labeled "Final_Information". Also in this folder, there are several screenshots of the web application.
